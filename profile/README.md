4. **Battle Mechanics**:
   The battles in Magic Chess Go Go are automatic once players have placed their units on the board. However, the strategy comes in the form of placement and unit selection. Players will need to predict how their units will interact with the opposing forces, which adds a level of depth to the strategic planning required to win.
